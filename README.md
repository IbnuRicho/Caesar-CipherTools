# 🔐 Cipher Tool with Machine Learning (Flask Web App)

This project is a **Flask** based web application that provides **encryption and decryption** features for text using **Caesar Cipher** and **Random Substitution**, and displays **the frequency of letters** in the text. This system is equipped with a **Machine Learning Naive Bayes** model to **predict the Caesar Cipher shift value** automatically during the decryption process.

## 🧠 About Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model used is the Naive Bayes Classifier, which is trained to recognize the distribution pattern of letters in the ciphertext to predict the shift value of the Caesar Cipher. The training process uses a supervised learning approach, and text features are extracted using the TF-IDF Vectorizer.

## 📊 Letter Frequency Visualization
This application displays a bar chart of letter frequencies using Chart.js, which compares the frequency of letters in the input with the standard English frequency. This feature helps users understand the distribution of letters and supports the decryption process visually.
